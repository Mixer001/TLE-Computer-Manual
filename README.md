## The *F+-* Language
The code is written in *F+-*, a language created specially for this machine. Its name refers to adding and removing food from the memory, 
which is how you write commands. Also, addition and subtraction are the only supported arithmetic operations. Despite this limitation, 
multiplication and division algorithms can be written by the user.

> Commands are 20-bit numbers saved in the program memory. Placing food inside a memory bit marks it as **1**, no food means **0**.
> There are 32 rows in the memory, each corresponding to a single line of code. They are executed from the bottom up and once the end is reached,
> it returns to row 0.
